# A Gender Perspective in Global Diplomacy (1968–2021)

What is this project about?

This project explores gender representation in global diplomacy by analyzing the dataset “Gender and Diplomatic Representation: Ambassador postings worldwide (1968–2021).” Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends and disparities in gender representation, regional differences, and the progression of female participation in diplomacy over the decades.

Project Overview

Dataset

The dataset contains diplomatic postings from 1968 to 2021, offering insights into gender distribution across regions, countries, and significant global entities such as G8 countries and the Greater Middle East (GME).

Key Steps

	1. Reading the Dataset:
    Initial exploration to understand the structure, distribution, and key attributes of the dataset.
	2.	Data Cleaning:
	•	Dropping unnecessary columns to streamline the analysis.
	•	Identifying and filtering out missing values (e.g., rows with gender labeled as “99”).
	3.	Data Mapping:
	•	Gender Mapping: Reorganizing gender labels for clarity (e.g., mapping to “Male” and “Female”).
	•	Region Mapping: Categorizing countries into broader regional groups.
	•	G8 Mapping: Highlighting G8 countries, with acknowledgment of Russia’s suspension in 2014.

   Research Questions

This project addresses the following key questions:
	1.	Global Gender Distribution:
	•	What is the gender distribution of diplomats globally from 1968 to 2021?
	2.	Regional Analysis:
	•	How are female representatives distributed regionally?
	3.	Country-Level Representation:
	•	Which 10 countries have the highest and lowest female representation?
	4.	GME vs. Non-GME Comparison:
	•	How does gender representation differ between Greater Middle East (GME) countries and Non-GME countries?
	5.	Female Representation in G8 Countries:
	•	What is the distribution of female diplomats among G8 countries (excluding Russia post-2014)?
	6.	Gender and Titles Correlation:
	•	Is there a correlation between diplomatic titles and gender?

     Key Deliverables

Data Exploration and Analysis

	1.	Contingency Table:
    A detailed table showing the relationship between diplomatic titles and gender representation.
	2.	Graphical Insights:
	•	Tableau Graph 1: Evolution of female representation in the GME.
	•	Tableau Graph 2: Female legislative participation by gender.
	3.	Short Explanations for Graphs:
	•	Tableau Graph 1 illustrates the progress of female representatives in the GME over time.
	•	Tableau Graph 2 highlights comparative legislative participation by gender, providing context for diplomacy trends.

    Tools and Technologies

	•	Tableau: For visualizing key insights and trends.
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation and exploratory analysis.

    Why Does This Matter?

Gender representation in diplomacy is a key indicator of inclusivity and equity in governance. By analyzing over 50 years of data, this project highlights progress made and the challenges that remain.
